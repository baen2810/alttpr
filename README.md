A collection of tools to help with analytics on 'A Link to the Past Randomizer' races.

ALttPR is a collection of tools to build game analytics pipelines f√ºr 'A Link to the Past Randomizer' games.
ALttPR pretty cool. If you want to learn more about Randomizers and Romhacking, checkout  (https://alttpr.com/en).
Each playthrough shuffles the location of all the important items in the game making it a unique adventure.

Currently, the main element of alttpr is the `RacetimeCrawler` which is a wrapper that helps crawl race data fr

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `pip` that you
use for building your own bots.  See the [documentation](https://hubotio.github.io/hubot/docs.html)
for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.

# Create your own ALttPR instance

Clone the repository. This will create a directory `alttpr` in the current working directory.

Install requirements:

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change the working dir to './alttpr:
```cmd
cd ./alttpr
```

Run the code snippet:

```py
from alttpr.crawlers import RacetimeCrawler
from alttpr.utils import to_tstr, pprint

# Example usage
gg = RacetimeCrawler()
gg.crawl(host_ids=["XzVwZWqJmkB5k8eb", "jb8GPMWwXbB1nEk0"], n_pages=2)  # crawl 

pprint(f'Crawler host_ids: {gg.host_ids}')  # Output: ['XzVwZWqJmkB5k8eb', 'jb8GPMWwXbB1nEk0']
pprint(f'Crawler host_df.shape: {gg.hosts_df.shape}')  # Output: DataFrame with combined hosts data
pprint(f'Crawler Last updated: {to_tstr(gg.last_updated)}')

df = gg.get_df()  # get crawled raw data
pprint(f'Crawler raw data shape: {df.shape}')

# Export DataFrames to './export/'
gg.export()

# Save the crawler object to './export/racetime_crawler.pkl'
gg.save()

# Load the crawler object
loaded_gg = RacetimeCrawler.load("export/racetime_crawler.pkl")
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler host_ids: {loaded_gg.host_ids}')  # Output: ['XzVwZWqJmkB5k8eb', 'jb8GPMWwXbB1nEk0']
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler host_df.shape: {loaded_gg.hosts_df.shape}')  # Output: Shape of DataFrame with combined hosts data
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler len(self.race_ids): {len(loaded_gg.race_ids)}')  # Output: Length of list with race ids
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler races_df.shape: {loaded_gg.races_df.shape}')  # Output: Shape of DataFrame with races data
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler Last updated: {to_tstr(loaded_gg.last_updated)}')

pprint('Finished.')
```
or simply do

```py
python ./example_create_save_load_crawler.py
```
