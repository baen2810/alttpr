# alttpr
A collection of tools to help with analytics on 'A Link to the Past Randomizer' races.

ALttPR is a collection of tools to build game analytics pipelines f√ºr 'A Link to the Past Randomizer' games.
ALttPR pretty cool. If you want to learn more about Randomizers and Romhacking, checkout  (https://alttpr.com/en).
Each playthrough shuffles the location of all the important items in the game making it a unique adventure.

Currently, the main elements of alttpr are
- the `RacetimeCrawler` which is a wrapper that helps crawl race data from racetime.gg
- the `DunkaScanner` which helps to scan ALttPR VODs that use the Dunka Tracker

# Crawl racetime.gg data using the RacetimeCrawler

Clone the repository. This will create a directory `alttpr` in the current working directory.

Import 

```py
from alttpr.crawlers import RacetimeCrawler
from alttpr.utils import to_tstr, pprint

# Example usage
gg = RacetimeCrawler()
gg.crawl(host_ids=["XzVwZWqJmkB5k8eb", "jb8GPMWwXbB1nEk0"], n_pages=2)  # crawl 

pprint(f'Crawler host_ids: {gg.host_ids}')  # Output: ['XzVwZWqJmkB5k8eb', 'jb8GPMWwXbB1nEk0']
pprint(f'Crawler host_df.shape: {gg.hosts_df.shape}')  # Output: DataFrame with combined hosts data
pprint(f'Crawler Last updated: {to_tstr(gg.last_updated)}')

df = gg.get_df()  # get crawled raw data
pprint(f'Crawler raw data shape: {df.shape}')

# Export DataFrames to './export/'
gg.export()

# Save the crawler object to './export/racetime_crawler.pkl'
gg.save()

# Load the crawler object
loaded_gg = RacetimeCrawler.load("export/racetime_crawler.pkl")
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler host_ids: {loaded_gg.host_ids}')  # Output: ['XzVwZWqJmkB5k8eb', 'jb8GPMWwXbB1nEk0']
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler host_df.shape: {loaded_gg.hosts_df.shape}')  # Output: DataFrame with combined hosts data
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler len(self.race_ids): {len(loaded_gg.race_ids)}')  # Output: DataFrame with combined hosts data
pprint(f'Loaded Crawler Last updated: {to_tstr(loaded_gg.last_updated)}')

pprint('Finished.')
```
or simply do

```py
python ./example_create_save_load_crawler.py
```

# Scan a local VOD of an ALttPR race using the DunkaScanner
If racers use the DunkaTracker, the DunkaScanner can scan the tracker status directly from the VOD. It will create a protocol file containing the tracker status at any given time troughout the VOD.

Simply do

```py
python ./example_create_save_vod_scanner.py
```

It will scan a short example video `tests/data/alttpr_bow.mp4`.

The scanner may require some calibration, it will walk you through five steps:
1) Select race start: Use the keybindings to find the race start frame in the VOD
2) Select race end: Use the keybindings to find the race end frame in the VOD
3) Select item tracker box and sensor points: Use the keybindings to align the item tracker scanner box with the location of the Dunka item tracker in the VOD
4) Select lightworld map tracker box and sensor points: Use the keybindings to align the lightworld map tracker scanner box with the location of the Dunka lightworld map tracker in the VOD
5) Select darkworld map tracker box and sensor points: Use the keybindings to align the darkworld map tracker scanner box with the location of the Dunka darkworld map tracker in the VOD

Once these steps have been completed, the scanner parses the video and produces output artifacts. Check the console output.

# Testing
To check code integrity, simply do

```py
python .\tests\execute_all_tests.py 
```

Various tests will be executed. Check console output for errors.
